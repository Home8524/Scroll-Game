Here's the order of layering the World 4 assets, from top to bottom.

Everything that is perfectly locked with the camera, and thus will be stationary, is labeled.

Top
the track and the balls, of course
the pink recolored ruins A-D
world4_ruins A-D blurs
world4_dunes
world4_bg [LOCKED]
the visualizer you make [LOCKED]
pixelstalk_A [LOCKED]
world4_skysquares 1 and 2 alternating [LOCKED]
world4_sky [LOCKED]
Bottom

Skysquares 1 and 2 alternate on the beat, or every 2 beats, whichever looks cooler. I know I messed them up on the right, but it gets covered by the pixelstalk, so don't worry about that.

Have the pixelstalk's brightness pulse to the volume, just like the lanterns' light did.

I think it would be cool if you copy-paste world4_dunes and have it scroll in a loop horizontally just like the stalagmites in 3-X. Just probably have it go slower than that, due to the different tempo and mood of the song.

For the pink blocks, I hope it'll work if you just recolor the ruins from 2-X in Unity. But even so, I wasn't sure if you'd be able to get the blur effect on it in Unity, so I provided you with the blurs myself. Just put them behind the blocks, parent them together, and have the glow flicker and pulse in brightness or opacity~

The visualizer, pixelstalk, and sky squares should hopefully handle most of the "changing on the beat." Here's 2 ideas I had for song moment-specific stuff:

If you look at world4_sample_lightning, we could have some lightning strike down at a few key hits in the song. It could come in suddenly, then fade out for like 3 beats. I'm thinking this could happen at the big hit of the drop at 0:25, then save it for the second half of the song and use it at 1:33, 1:39, 1:44, and like 1:54 to build the intensity of the end.


At about 1:10, when the backing instrumetal drops out, the world could fade into darkness a bit, leaving the focus on the bright stalk of energy. That part feels like everything turns into a hushed whisper, and feels "cooler" [temperature-wise] so I wanted to maybe drop the lights and take the player's eyes off all the purple. Might be a cool effect, I don't know! To do it, you'd simply have world4_shadow start sloooowly coming in from 0% opacity, ending at like 60%. Then you can have it fade back to 0% at like 1:33 when the music snaps back. Check world4_sample_darkness to see what I mean. If you're not a fan of this effect, we can think of something else for that segment of the track!

I hope this is enough for now! I think the visualizer and the pulsing of the squares and pixelstalk will do a lot to add life to it.
